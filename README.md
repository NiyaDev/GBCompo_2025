#### Gameplay

The player is dropped into a randomly generated dungeon with the goal of finding the staircase down to lower levels where the monsters become stronger and stronger.

Instead of finding loot or leveling to get stronger, the PC has stats such as 1-handed, defense, etc and as they are used, they increase and the PC becomes stronger.

New items found are either weak weapons to replace broken ones or ingredients to make potions.
